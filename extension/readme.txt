How to load the extension:
Google Chrome extension-> Load unpacked -> select the extension folder

1) InjectedContentUI.html: the injected Html button on Amazon product page

  Note that the "Track item" button is a dummy right now which has no functionality

2) DashboardContent.html: the content page for the tracked product list.

  Take a random number and dynamically generate a random amount of pages based on that number.
  The first item tracked is set as the product page the user is browsing currently.
